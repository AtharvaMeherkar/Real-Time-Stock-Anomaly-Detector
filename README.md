ü§ñ AI-Powered Real-Time Market Anomaly Detector
An intelligent, real-time data analysis engine that monitors cryptocurrency markets for statistical anomalies, correlates them with global news sentiment, and sends instant multi-channel alerts.
üåü Overview
In the volatile, 24/7 world of cryptocurrency, critical market events can happen in the blink of an eye. This project provides a powerful solution: an automated system that not only detects unusual market activity but also helps you understand the potential reasons behind it.

The application establishes a high-performance data pipeline to ingest live trade data, uses a robust statistical model to identify anomalies in both price and volume, and then enriches this data by fetching and analyzing the sentiment of related news headlines. When a significant event is confirmed, it's logged to a database and you're notified instantly via Email and SMS.

‚ú® Key Features
‚ö° Real-Time, Multi-Asset Monitoring: Utilizes asyncio and a single WebSocket to efficiently monitor multiple tickers (BTC, ETH, SOL) concurrently.

üß† Multi-Factor Anomaly Detection: Implements a statistical Z-score model that flags anomalies only when both price and trading volume show statistically significant deviations.

üì∞ AI-Powered News Correlation: Automatically fetches relevant news headlines from a global news API upon detecting an anomaly.

üí¨ NLP Sentiment Analysis: Uses TextBlob to perform Natural Language Processing on headlines, providing crucial context (Positive, Negative, Neutral) for market movements.

üíæ Persistent Data Logging: All confirmed anomalies and their correlated news data are permanently stored in a local SQLite database for historical analysis.

üîî Multi-Channel Alert System: Sends instant, detailed alert notifications via both Email (using SendGrid) and SMS (using Twilio).

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The application operates on a modern, event-driven architecture designed for high throughput and resilience.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project leverages a powerful combination of modern Python libraries and external APIs.

Core Language: Python 3.8+

Concurrency: asyncio - For non-blocking, I/O-bound operations.

Networking: websockets - For high-performance, real-time data streaming.

Data Analysis: numpy - For lightning-fast statistical calculations.

NLP: textblob - For simple and effective sentiment analysis.

Database: sqlite3 - For lightweight, serverless, persistent data storage.

Alerting APIs: sendgrid (Email) & twilio (SMS) - For reliable, professional-grade notifications.

Configuration: python-dotenv - For securely managing API keys and secrets.

3. Creating requirements.txt
To make installation easier for others, create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

websockets
numpy
python-dotenv
requests
textblob
twilio
sendgrid
pandas

4. Configuration (.env file)
Your .env file must be filled out with your secret keys. Use the following template:

# --- API KEYS ---
FINNHUB_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_FINNHUB_API_KEY_HERE"
GNEWS_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_GNEWS_API_KEY_HERE"

# --- EMAIL SETTINGS (SENDGRID) ---
SENDGRID_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY_HERE"
SENDER_EMAIL="your_verified_sender_email@example.com"
RECIPIENT_EMAIL="your_personal_email@example.com"

# --- SMS SETTINGS (TWILIO) ---
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="PASTE_YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID_HERE"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="PASTE_YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE"
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="+1..." # Your Twilio phone number
RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER="+91..." # Your verified personal number

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage
1. Run the Main Analyzer
To start monitoring the markets, run the main script from your activated virtual environment:

python stock_analyzer.py

The script will run continuously until you stop it.

2. View Logged Anomalies
After at least one anomaly has been detected, you can view the contents of the database:

python read_db.py

3. Stop the Application
To stop the main analyzer, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it is running.

üîÆ Future Scope
Interactive Web Dashboard: Build a real-time dashboard with Flask or Streamlit to visualize the data.

Machine Learning Integration: Replace the static Z-score model with an unsupervised ML model (e.g., Isolation Forest) for more adaptive detection.

Containerization: Package the application with Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
